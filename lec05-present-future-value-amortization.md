# Present & Future Values, Annuities, Amortization and Bond Yield

## Present Value
**Present Value (PV)**: Present value is the current worth of a sum of money to be received or paid in the future, given a specific interest rate. It reflects the idea that a dollar received in the future is worth less than a dollar received today.

**Formula**:

$$PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}$$

Where:

- PV is the present value
- FV is the future value
- r is the interest rate
- n is the number of compounding periods or time period

## Future Value
**Future Value (FV)**: Future value is the value of an investment or a sum of money at a specified point in the future, assuming a specific interest rate. It reflects the growth of money over time.

**Formula**:

$$FV = PV \cdot (1 + r)^n$$

Where:

- FV is the future value
- PV is the present value
- r is the interest rate
- n is the number of compounding periods or time periods

## Annuities
**Annuities**: An annuity is a series of equal periodic payments or receipts made at regular intervals. Annuities can be used for various financial calculations, including retirement savings and loan repayments.

### Present Value of an Annuity
**Present Value of Annuity (PV of Annuity)**: The present value of a series of future payments or receipts.

**Formula**:

$$PV_{\text{Annuity}} = \frac{PMT}{r} \left(1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n}\right)$$

Where:

- $$PV_{\text{Annuity}}$$ is the present value of the annuity
- PMT is the periodic payment or receipt
- r is the interest rate per period
- n is the total number of periods

### Future Value of an Annuity
**Future Value of Annuity (FV of Annuity)**: The future value of a series of future payments or receipts.

**Formula**:

$$FV_{\text{Annuity}} = PMT \cdot \left(\frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}\right)$$

Where:

- $$FV_{\text{Annuity}}$$ is the future value of the annuity
- PMT is the periodic payment or receipt
- r is the interest rate per period
- n is the total number of periods

## Amortization
**Amortization**: Amortization is the process of paying off a debt through a series of regular payments. These payments typically consist of both principal and interest portions. Amortization schedules show how each payment is allocated between principal and interest over time.

### Loan Amortization Schedule
A detailed table or chart that outlines each scheduled payment, the interest and principal portions of the payment, and the remaining loan balance.

## Bond Yield
**Bond Yield**: Bond yield is the return an investor can expect to receive from a bond. It is typically expressed as an annual percentage rate and is a key factor in bond investing.

### Yield to Maturity (YTM)
The total return anticipated on a bond if it is held until it matures.

**Formula**:

$$YTM = \frac{C + \frac{F - P}{n}}{\frac{F + P}{2}}$$

Where:

- YTM is the yield to maturity
- C is the annual coupon payment
- F is the face value of the bond
- P is the purchase price of the bond
- n is the number of years to maturity
