## Interest Rates and Present Value**

**Interest rates**: Returns earned from an investment without risk. They serve as benchmarks for assessing other investments.

- **Types**:

    - **Simple Interest**: Interest calculated solely on the initial principal amount for a specified period.
    
        $$[I = P \cdot t \cdot r\]$$

        Where:
        - *I* is the interest earned or paid.
        - *P* is the principal amount (initial amount of money).
        - *r* is the interest rate per period (expressed as a decimal).
        - *t* is the time period (in years).

    - **Compound Interest**: Interest calculated on both the initial principal amount and any accumulated interest for a specified period.
    
        $$[I = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}\]$$

        Where:
        - *I* is the interest earned.
        - *P* is the principal amount (initial amount of money).
        - *r* is the annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal).
        - *n* is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
        - *t* is the time the money is invested or borrowed for (in years).

    - **Continuous Interest**: Interest calculated when compounding occurs continuously, without discrete periods.
    
        $$A = P \cdot e^{rt}\]$$

        Where:
        - *A* is the future value of the investment, including interest.
        - *P* is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
        - *e* is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828.
        - *r* is the annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal).
        - *t* is the time period (in years).

**Time Value of Money**: The concept that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential to earn interest or returns. It underlies various financial calculations.

**Present value**: The value today of a future payment, calculated as the amount that, when invested at a given rate today, would result in the given value of the future payment. It reflects the time value of money.
