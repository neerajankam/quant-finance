## **Capital Market Line, Capital Asset Pricing Model**

# Capital Market Line

The **Capital Market Line (CML)** is a concept in finance that represents the relationship between risk and return for a portfolio that includes a risk-free asset and a risky asset (often the market portfolio). The CML provides a graphical representation and mathematical model for evaluating the risk-return trade-off for portfolios that combine these two types of assets.

The equation for the CML is:

\[ \mu_p = R + \frac{\mu(M) - R}{\sigma(M)} \cdot \sigma_p \]

Here's an explanation of the terms:

- \( \mu_p \) represents the expected return of the portfolio on the Capital Market Line.
- \( R \) is the risk-free rate.
- \( \mu(M) \) is the expected return of the market portfolio.
- \( \sigma(M) \) is the standard deviation (volatility) of the market portfolio.
- \( \sigma_p \) is the standard deviation of the portfolio located on the Capital Market Line.

This equation describes the relationship between the expected return and standard deviation of portfolios on the CML, considering the risk-free rate \( R \) and the market portfolio's characteristics \( \sigma(M) \) and \( \mu(M) \). It allows investors to assess the risk-return trade-offs for portfolios that combine the risk-free asset and the market portfolio. The second term is called the "Risk premium."

The MVL is a subset of the CML. Specifically, the point on the CML where the tangent line from the risk-free rate intersects the CML is the same as the tangency portfolio on the MVL.

# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The risk of a portfolio containing many risky assets is mainly affected by the covariances of the assets, and the individual variances of the assets are largely irrelevant as \( n \) (number of assets) becomes large.

The **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** is a financial model that helps investors and analysts determine the expected return on an asset or portfolio by considering its risk relative to the overall market. It's based on several key assumptions:

1. **Risk-Free Rate (Rf):** There is a risk-free rate of return, typically associated with government bonds. Investors can earn this rate with no risk.
2. **Market Risk Premium (Rm - Rf):** The excess return an investor can earn by taking on the risk of investing in the market as a whole compared to the risk-free rate.
3. **Systematic Risk:** The total risk of an asset can be divided into systematic risk (market risk) and unsystematic risk (unique to the asset). CAPM focuses on systematic risk, which can't be eliminated through diversification.
4. **Beta (\(\beta\)):** Beta measures an asset's sensitivity to market movements. A beta of 1 means the asset moves with the market; a beta greater than 1 indicates higher sensitivity, and a beta less than 1 indicates lower sensitivity.

\[ \mu(V) = R_f + \beta \cdot (\mu(M) - R_f) \]

In this formula:

- \( \mu(V) \) represents the expected return on the asset or portfolio.
- \( R_f \) is the risk-free rate.
- \( \beta \) is the asset's beta.
- \( \mu(M) \) is the expected return of the market portfolio.
- \( \mu(M) - R_f \) represents the market risk premium.
