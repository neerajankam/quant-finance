# Price Yield Curve and Term Structure of Interest Rates

## Bonds and Key Terms

Bonds are debt securities that represent a loan made by an investor to a borrower, typically a government or corporation. In exchange for the bond purchase, the issuer (borrower) agrees to pay periodic interest payments to the bondholder (investor) and return the bond's principal amount at the end of the bond's term. Here are some key terms related to bonds:

### Pure Discount Bonds

- Pure discount bonds are also known as zero-coupon bonds. These bonds do not make periodic interest payments (coupons) during their term.
- Instead, they are issued at a discount to their face value and pay the investor the full face value when they mature.
- The return to the investor is the difference between the purchase price and the face value, and this represents the interest earned on the bond.

### Coupon Bonds

- Coupon bonds, unlike pure discount bonds, make regular interest payments to the bondholder (coupon payments).
- These interest payments are typically made semi-annually, annually, or at other predetermined intervals.
- At the end of the bond's term, the issuer returns the face value of the bond to the investor.

### Nominal/ Face Value

- The nominal value, also known as the par value or face value, is the amount that a bond will be worth at its maturity date.
- It is the principal amount that the bondholder will receive when the bond reaches its maturity.
- The nominal value is often $1,000 for corporate bonds and can vary for government bonds.

In summary, bonds are debt instruments where investors lend money to an issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the nominal or face value when the bond matures. Pure discount bonds don't make periodic interest payments but are sold at a discount to face value, while coupon bonds pay regular interest (coupon) payments and return the face value at maturity. The nominal value and face value are essentially the same, representing the bond's redemption value.

## Bond Price and Yield Relationship

Let's illustrate the inverse relationship between a bond's yield and its price with a simple example:

Suppose you have a 10-year bond with a face value of $1,000, and it pays a fixed annual coupon rate of 5%. This means you receive $50 in interest every year (5% of $1,000).

### Scenario 1: Market Interest Rates Remain Unchanged

- In this scenario, the market interest rate remains at 5%, which is the same as the bond's coupon rate.
- The bond's price would be at its face value of $1,000 because its coupon payments are in line with the market rate.
- The bond's yield is equal to its coupon rate, which is 5%.

### Scenario 2: Market Interest Rates Rise to 6%

- Suppose market interest rates increase to 6%.
- Your existing bond is still paying a fixed 5% coupon rate, but new bonds being issued in the market now offer a 6% coupon rate.
- To make your 5% coupon bond attractive in the new market environment, its price must decrease. The bond's price might fall to around $950 in this case.
- As a result of the lower price, the bond's yield increases. It would now have a yield of approximately 5.26% because you are still receiving $50 in annual interest, but it is based on the lower purchase price of $950.

### Scenario 3: Market Interest Rates Fall to 4%

- Conversely, if market interest rates decline to 4%, your existing 5% coupon bond becomes more attractive because it offers a higher interest rate compared to new bonds in the market.
- Investors are willing to pay a premium for your bond. Its price might increase to around $1,050.
- As the bond's price rises, its yield decreases. The bond would now have a yield of approximately 4.76% because you are still receiving $50 in annual interest, but it is based on the higher purchase price of $1,050.

In summary, when market interest rates rise above the bond's fixed coupon rate, the bond's price falls, and its yield increases to align with the new market rates. Conversely, when market interest rates fall below the bond's fixed coupon rate, the bond's price rises, and its yield decreases. This demonstrates the inverse relationship between a bond's yield and its price.
