# Introduction to Stocks, Futures & Forwards, and Swaps

## Stocks

**Stocks**, also known as equities, are a type of financial security that represents ownership in a company. When individuals or institutions purchase stocks, they become shareholders of the company and have a claim on its assets and earnings.

Stocks are traded in financial markets, such as stock exchanges, where buyers and sellers come together to trade shares. The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand dynamics in the market.

Investing in stocks offers potential returns through capital appreciation (increase in stock price) and dividends (share of company profits distributed to shareholders). However, stocks also carry risks, including fluctuations in stock prices, market volatility, and the potential for a loss of investment.

Stocks are an important component of investment portfolios and are widely used by individuals and institutions to build wealth and achieve financial goals.

## Derivatives

**Derivatives** are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset or group of assets. They are traded to manage risk, speculate on price movements, and hedge positions. Derivatives provide risk management tools, opportunities for speculation, and contribute to market liquidity and efficiency.

## Futures

**Futures** are a type of derivative contract that obligates the parties involved to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. They are traded in futures markets and are used for various purposes, including hedging and speculation.

Futures contracts are standardized agreements that specify the quantity, quality, and delivery date of the underlying asset. They allow market participants to lock in prices and manage risks associated with price fluctuations. By entering into a futures contract, buyers and sellers can mitigate the potential impact of price volatility on their portfolios or businesses.

Futures are traded for several reasons. First, they provide a way for producers and consumers of commodities, such as agricultural products or energy resources, to hedge against price changes. For example, a farmer can enter into a futures contract to sell their crops at a predetermined price to protect against potential price declines.

Second, futures are used for speculative purposes. Traders may speculate on the future direction of an asset's price and enter into futures contracts to profit from price movements. This can be done by taking long (buying) or short (selling) positions in futures contracts.

Lastly, futures contribute to market liquidity and efficiency. They allow for the transfer of risk between market participants and facilitate price discovery in the market. The trading of futures contracts helps in establishing fair market prices for the underlying assets, which benefits both buyers and sellers.

The payoff in terms of market price, spot price, and future price using times t and T can be represented by the following formulas:

Market Price Payoff:

- Payoff = M(T) - M(t)

Spot Price Payoff:

- Payoff = S(T) - S(t)

Future Price Payoff:

- Payoff = F(T) - F(t)

Where:

- M(T) represents the market price at time T
- M(t) represents the market price at time t
- S(T) represents the spot price at time T
- S(t) represents the spot price at time t
- F(T) represents the future price at time T
- F(t) represents the future price at time t

## Swaps

**Swaps** are derivative contracts that involve the exchange of cash flows between two or more parties. They are traded to manage risks, alter cash flow profiles, and speculate on interest rate movements.

There are several types of swaps:

1. **Interest Rate Swaps**: These involve the exchange of fixed-rate and floating-rate cash flows based on a notional amount. The parties involved agree to exchange interest payments, with one party paying a fixed rate and the other paying a floating rate based on a reference rate such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). Interest rate swaps are commonly used to manage interest rate risk, achieve desired cash flow profiles, or take advantage of comparative advantages in borrowing costs.

2. **Currency Swaps**: These involve the exchange of principal and interest payments denominated in different currencies. The parties involved agree to exchange cash flows based on a notional amount and predetermined exchange rates. Currency swaps are used to manage currency risk, obtain foreign currency funding, or take advantage of differences in interest rates between countries.

3. **Commodity Swaps**: These involve the exchange of cash flows based on the price of a specific commodity. The parties involved agree to exchange payments based on the difference between the reference price and the market price of the commodity. Commodity swaps are used to manage price risk for commodities such as oil, natural gas, or agricultural products.

4. **Credit Default Swaps**: These involve the transfer of credit risk associated with a specific reference entity or debt instrument. In a credit default swap, one party agrees to make periodic payments to the other party in exchange for protection against default by the reference entity. Credit default swaps are used to hedge credit exposures, speculate on credit quality, or gain synthetic exposure to specific credit instruments.

Swaps are traded for various reasons. They allow parties to customize their cash flow profiles, manage risks, and take advantage of market opportunities. By exchanging cash flows, parties can effectively convert fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations or vice versa. Swaps also provide flexibility in managing interest rate, currency, commodity, or credit risks based on specific needs and market conditions.

Overall, swaps are widely used in financial markets to achieve desired cash flow profiles, manage risks, and enhance financial flexibility.
