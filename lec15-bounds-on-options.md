## **Bounds on Options**

- American call put parity estimate

$$
S(0) - Xe^{-rT} \geq C^A - P^A \geq S(0) - X

$$

Where:

- *S*(0) = Initial stock price
- *X* = Strike price of the options
- *e* = The base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)
- *r* = Risk-free interest rate
- *T* = Time to expiration
- *CA* = Price of an American call option
- *PA* = Price of an American put option

With dividends

$$
S(0) - Xe^{-rT} \geq C^A - P^A \geq S(0) - X - \text{div}(0)

$$

- *S*(0) = Initial stock price
- *X* = Strike price of the options
- *e* = The base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828)
- *r* = Risk-free interest rate
- *T* = Time to expiration
- *CA* = Price of an American call option
- *PA* = Price of an American put option
- div(0) = Present value of expected dividends at time *t*=0
