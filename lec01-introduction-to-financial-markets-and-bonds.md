    - **Swaps**: Agreements between two parties to exchange financial instruments, such as interest rates or currencies.
    - **Options**: Contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on or before a particular date.

## Bonds
- **Amount**: Nominal Value/Principal
- **Period**: Maturity Date
- **Parties Involved**: Debtor (Issuer), Creditor (Investor)
- *Creditor pays money to debtor, and upon maturity, debtor returns money*

### Types of Bonds
- **Short-Term (1 year or less)**: Bonds with a maturity of one year or less from the issue date.
- **Long-Term (> 1 year)**: Bonds with a maturity exceeding one year from the issue date.

### Risks
1. **Credit Risk**: The risk that the issuer of the bond may default on its payments, leading to a loss of principal or interest.
2. **Inflation Risk**: The risk that the purchasing power of the bond's future cash flows will be eroded by inflation.
3. **Liquidity Risk - Premature Selling**: The risk associated with selling a bond before its maturity date, which may result in receiving a price lower than the face value or market value due to lower demand or adverse market conditions.
