## **Minimum Variance Portfolio**

The Minimum Variance Portfolio is a concept in modern portfolio theory, which is a framework for constructing investment portfolios that aim to optimize the trade-off between expected return and risk. The Minimum Variance Portfolio is a portfolio that offers the lowest possible level of risk, or portfolio variance, for a given level of expected return.

$$
\text{Var}(K_v) = W_1^2 \cdot \text{Var}(K_1) + W_2^2 \cdot \text{Var}(K_2) + 2 \cdot W_1 \cdot W_2 \cdot \text{Cov}(K_1, K_2)
$$

- *Var*(*Kv*) is the portfolio variance.
- *W*1 and 2 are the weights of Asset 1 and Asset 2 in the portfolio, respectively.
- Var(*K*1) and Var(2) are the variances of the returns of Asset 1 and Asset 2, respectively.
- Cov(*K*1, 2) is the covariance between the returns of Asset 1 and Asset 2.

$$
\text{Cov}(K_1, K_2) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (K_{1i} - \bar{K_1})(K_{2i} - \bar{K_2})
$$

- Cov(*K*1, 2) is the covariance between the returns of Asset 1 (1) and Asset 2 (2)
- *K*1*i* and 2 are individual observations of the returns of Asset 1 and Asset 2, respectively.
- *K*1 and 2 are the means (average values) of the returns of Asset 1 and Asset 2, respectively.
- *n* is the number of data points or observations.


**Feasible set**
    
In the context of portfolio theory, a feasible set refers to a set of portfolios that can be constructed based on the available assets and their associated weights while satisfying certain constraints. These constraints often include risk and return parameters, asset allocation limits, and other investment requirements.
