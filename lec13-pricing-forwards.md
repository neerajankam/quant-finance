## ****No Arbitrage Principle and Pricing of Forward Contracts****

## No arbitrage principle
    
The No Arbitrage Principle is a fundamental concept in finance and economics that serves as a guiding principle for the pricing of financial assets and securities. It asserts that in an efficient and well-functioning financial market, it should not be possible to make risk-free profits (arbitrage opportunities) by exploiting price discrepancies between related assets. In other words, the principle implies that if an arbitrage opportunity were to exist, rational investors would quickly take advantage of it, thereby eliminating it.

## No dividends
    
$$
F = S_0 e^{(rT)}
$$
    
    
- *F* is the forward price of the contract.
- *S*0 is the current spot price of the underlying asset.
- *r* is the risk-free interest rate.
- *T* is the time to maturity of the forward contract (in years).

## Dividends
    
$$
F(0, T) = \left(S(0) - e^{-rt} \cdot \text{div}\right) \cdot e^{rT}
$$
    
- *F*(0,*T*) represents the forward price of the contract at time *t*=0 with maturity at time *T*.
- *S*(0) is the current spot price of the underlying asset at time *t*=0.
- *r* is the risk-free interest rate.
- *T* is the time to maturity of the forward contract (in years).
- divdiv represents the total dividends or income generated by the underlying asset during the life of the forward contract.

## Continuous dividends
    
$$
F = S_0 e^{(r - r_{\text{div}})T}
$$
    
- *F* represents the forward price of the contract.
- *S*0 is the current spot price of the underlying asset.
- *r* is the risk-free interest rate.
- *r*div is the dividend yield of the underlying asset.
- *T* is the time to maturity of the forward contract (in years).

## Value of forward contracts

$$
V(t) = [F(t, T) - F(0, T)] \cdot e^{-r(T-t)}
$$

- *V*(*t*) is the MTM value of the forward contract at time *t*.
- *F*(*t*,*T*) is the forward price of the contract at time *t* with maturity at time *T*.
- *F*(0,*T*) is the initial forward price of the contract at time *t*=0 with maturity at time *T*.
- *r* is the risk-free interest rate.
- *T* is the time to maturity of the forward contract.
- *t* is the specific point in time between 0 and *T* at which you want to calculate the MTM value.
